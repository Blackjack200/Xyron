# Xyron - Minecraft Bedrock Edition Concept Anticheat

Xyron is a concept anticheat designed for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. It aims to provide a robust solution for detecting
and preventing cheating in Bedrock servers, ensuring fair gameplay and a positive gaming experience for all players.

## Project Structure

The Xyron project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the
project structure:

### 1. `anticheat`

This directory contains the backend server demo, written in Golang. The backend server is responsible for handling
anticheat functionalities and processing player data. It acts as the core component of the Xyron anticheat system.

### 2. `implementation`

Here you can find the anticheat check demo. This section demonstrates how the anticheat mechanisms work in practice,
showcasing various cheat-detection techniques implemented in the concept. This demo allows you to see the anticheat in
action and understand its effectiveness.

### 3. `src/main/proto`

The `src/main/proto` directory contains the protobuf files used for data exchange and communication between different
components of the Xyron anticheat system. These files define the data structures and communication protocols that
facilitate seamless integration and interaction between various parts of the system.

### 4. `java_protobuf`, `src/main/php`, `xyron`

These directories store the generated code for Golang, derived from the protobuf files. The code in these directories is
used to implement specific functionalities of the Xyron anticheat system. The code is automatically generated based on
the defined data structures and communication protocols in the `src/main/proto` directory.

### 5. `nukkit_binding`

Nukkit frontend.

### 6. `anticheat_test_binding.go`

Dragonfly frontend.

## Getting Started

To start using Xyron, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Implement a proper backend server (for demonstrate, see `anticheat`).
3. Integrate the frontend binding into your Minecraft Bedrock server to connect it with the backend anticheat server.
   Refer to the documentation or README in the `implementation` directory for guidance.
4. If you want to understand the data exchange protocols, examine the protobuf files located in the `xchange` directory.
   These files define how data is formatted and exchanged between different components of the Xyron anticheat system.
